# happiness-journal
For the statistics lovers, the main goal of this journal is to identify patterns that impact happiness. 

By adding a tag and a "happiness" rating to each day, users will not only be able to keep track of their daily lives, but also the things that influence them, 
enabling users to assess what areas they need to improve.

Future versions will allow users to do a year-in review of their journal entries, which will include things like a line graph showing the happiness trajectory.
